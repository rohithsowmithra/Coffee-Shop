# Digital Coffee Shop

## Introduction

This project is about helping an institution to open a digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. They mainly need help in setting up their menu experience.

The application will:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.
