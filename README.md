# Digital Coffee Shop

## Introduction

This project is about helping an institution to open a digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. They mainly need help in setting up their menu experience.

This application does the following:

1) Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2) Allows public users to view drink names and graphics.
3) Allows the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4) Allows the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## Tech Stack
